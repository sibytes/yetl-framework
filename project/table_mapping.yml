apiVersion: yetl-framework.io/en/1/table_mapping
# this optional for declaring and code generating specific tables mappings
# it is not required however. Loading lineage is gathered from the spark
# DSL not this mapping. Dependencies like this are overly verbose so
# depends if you like writing yaml or just the python dsl.
# note we can acheive the same thing in python by wrapping generic dsl in a
# table operator.
